This framework is somehow inspired in the **MVC** pattern, followed by some PHP frameworks - CakePHP, Yii -.
The base concept is to provide an easy to mantain and extensible application framework 
purely based on the Javascript language - and its father ECMAScript (http://www.ecmascript.org/) -.
Due to the different natures of PHP and JS, some developers might find the js OOP patterns 
hard to follow, so some good knowledge of this subject is required in order to use daturajs.

By default, daturajs includes **REST** support so it's good for applications offering 
a REST API endpoint, providing you the opportunity to separate business logic from 
the presentation layer, and also serving your API to other clients such a mobile app 
or PHP application.

And if you're still wondering why this framework is so different from the others, 
daturajs provides a command line application which generates a fully functional 
app skeleton based on your database schema configuration. Not original, right? Well, 
daturajs is delivered with AngularJs - http://angularjs.org - support, so you'll get 
a full featured UI, with grids and modular forms so you can be up and running in a 
matter of minutes.

You won't believe how easy is to build a fast, modern and powerful application.


## Directory structure

Not being that far from its PHP counterparts, daturajs provides an understandable 
tree, containing most common folders for a web framework - althought this framework 
it is not only intended to be used in websites -.
The current status of the project reflects the following structure:

>**lib**  Core libraries and modules for custom framework implementation. 
No modifications may be needed to be done by the developer.
>>**doc**  Framework's documentation.
>
>>**adapters**  ORM adapters, etc. Many will be added in the future.
>
>>**components**  Core components widely used, including authentication.
>
>>**console**  Scripts that will generate models, controllers and views. 
More features will be added in the future - generate full app skeleton -.
>
>>**helpers**  Useful libraries (html, menu, etc).
>
>>**controllers**  Basic setup of application's controllers
>
>>>**rest**
>
>>**models**  Basic setup of application's models.
>
>**node_modules**  All nodejs libraries and dependencies are stored here.
>
>**public**  This folder is publicly accessed via GET /
>
>>**css**
>
>>**img**
>
>>**js**
>
>**src**  Most of your custom development tasks occur here.
>
>>**assets**  Assets that require some processing before being made public.
>
>>>**less**  Lesscss file that will be compiled into /public/css.
>
>>**config**  main.js is the setup file for your application. 
routes.js contains specification for URL paths and actions taken when receiving specific requests.
>
>>**controllers**  Your controllers will reside here.
>>>**rest**  If you need a REST API, this is the place to go.
>
>>**models**  ORM specific models.
>
>>**views**  This framework use the 'ejs' template system. 
Support for new engines is planned for the future.
>>>**elements**  Atomic elements to be included in your views.
>
>>>**layouts**  The templates for your views.
>
>>>**static**  Static pages should reside here.

## Installation / Setup

After you checkout or decompress the daturajs package, you must resolve all dependencies by 
issuing the following command:

```
npm install -d
```

## Application Skeleton generator

The application generator will let you setup your application in a few minutes. 
You'll end up by providing a rich-featured UI, built on top of AngularJS, serving 
a fast & powerful AJAX-based CRUD interface... without writting a piece of code!
Run this command without arguments to see how you can customize your new app.

```
node ./lib/console/generator.js
```

## Run / Execution

Since daturajs is a pure nodejs framework, there is no need to have an instance of a 
www server running - nginx, apache, etc -. The only method to make it work is by 
issuing the following command:

```
./start.sh
```

This file is generated by the application generator, so please check your valid 
port numbers when running it.
